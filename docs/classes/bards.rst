Bards
=====

These two bard subclasses came out of a jokey conversation on the
Discord channel for one of my campaigns.  After a bit of discussion
about the movies Hello Dolly and Fiddler on the Roof, the bard
suggested that there should be a matchmaker subclass.  Being the
responsive DM that I am, I obliged.

In further discussion, the rogue pointed out that Barbara Streisand's
character does a lot of gaslighting in Hello Dolly.  So I had to come
up with a gaslighter bard as well.

The matchmaker bard could be amazing in the right kind of role-play
heavy campaign.  I really hate the whole idea of the gaslighter bard
and would probably find a new player if someone at the table expressed
an interest in playing one.

College of Matchmaking
----------------------

Bards of the College of Matchmaking are called Yentas. Unlike other
bards – natural performers who shine brightest when at the center of
attention – Yentas try to control the ambiance of a room, fading into
the background while weaving songs of enchantment designed to foster
attraction and alliance between those hearing the music. While it is
certainly true that wealthy nobles will hire Yentas to play music at
balls introducing marriage age children to society, Yentas serve many
other purposes. Diplomats will engage the services of a Yenta when
negotiating treaties between warring nations.  Merchants will include
Yentas in sensitive business deals. There are even stories from the
markets of Waterdeep where bargain seekers will station a Yenta near a
market stall where the proprietor is known to drive a hard bargain.

    Bard Level   Feature                                         
   ============ ============================================================

    6th          Performance of Comprehension
    14th         Compelling Performance
   ============ ============================================================   


Bonus Proficiencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you join the College of Matchmakers at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency in animal handling (if you do not already have that).  You
gain proficiency in persuasion if you do not already have it.  If you
are already proficient in persuasion, you may double your proficiency
bonus in the manner of the 3rd level Expertise ability.

Enchanting Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 3rd level you can imbue your performance with enchanting magic. If
you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire
attraction between any parties engaged in conversation within 60 feet
of your performance. Enemies will be inclined to listen to their
foes. Neutral parties will see one another as friendly.  Friends will
see one another in a new light. This could result in a deepening
friendship, emotional intimacy, or even the beginning of physical
infatuation.

Each target can attempt a Charisma saving throw against your
spell DC. On success, they are not compelled to follow the attractive
suggestion of your performance. On a failure, your performance compels
the listener to reassess their relation in the manner suggested above.

Think of Enchanting Performance as a sort of mass Charm Person spell,
with some caveats. The Yenta is not explicitly directing the target’s
words or actions. The Yenta cannot make the target behave in a way
that is contrary to deeply held beliefs or social mores. And – most
importantly – Enchanting Performance cannot be used to change the
opinion of the target towards the Yenta.

As a College Of Matchmakers bard, you use your abilities to change how
others relate to one another, not how others relate to you, the bard.

Calm Emotions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 3rd level you may cast the Calm Emotions spell a number of times
equal to your proficiency modifier without using spell slots. This
ability resets after a long rest.

Performance of Comprehension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 6th level, you may perform for at least 1 minute. All intelligent
creatures capable of communication via spoken speech or other manner
of physical communication (exchange of scents, melodies, sign
language, flashing lights, and so on) within 20 feet are able to
understand one another as if Comprehend Languages were cast upon
them. This includes the limitations specifically called out in the
Comprehend Languages spell.

This may be performed a number of times equal to your proficiency
modifier and resets after a long rest.

Compelling Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 14th level, you are able to control the affections of your
audience. Once per day you may perform for at least 1 minute,
selecting as targets a number of individuals within 60 feet equal to
half your proficiency bonus, rounded up. The targets of this
performance must make a Charisma saving throw against your
spell DC. On a success, they respond in the generally positive manner
of Enchanting Performance. On a failure, you compel the target to
respond very favorably.  Enemies find common ground. Acquaintances
become fast friends. Friends become emotionally intimate.  Friends
become lovers.

Again, as a College Of Matchmaking bard, you use your abilities to
change how others relate to one another, not how others relate to you,
the bard.

College of Gaslighters
----------------------

You know that sketchy guy who is at every party, standing off to the
side with a crowd of sycophants. He’s got slightly greasy hair. He
uses too much product. He wears a jacket that’s never quite in
fashion. There is a core of people that say good things about him,
even defending him against criticism.  It’s weird. He just doesn’t
seem that great, but some folks are very loyal. If that guy ends up in
your adventuring party, he’s the one that you don’t quite click
with. A couple times, the paladin had to be talked down from smackin’
him upside the head with The Holy Avenger. That guy is a bard of the
College of Gaslighters. He kinda sucks, he’s always there, he’s oddly
good at whatever it is that he does.

    14th         Confounding Song
   ============ ====================================================================

Bonus Proficiencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you join the College of Gaslighters at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency in persuasion, intimidation, and deception if you do not
already have them.  If you are already proficient in persuasion,
intimidation, and/or deception, you may double your proficiency bonus
in the manner of the 3rd level Expertise ability.

Air of Attention and Avoidance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 3rd level you can manipulate your social standing in any
situation. A number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, you can
choose to your order of acting in a social situation. In any social
encounter, you may choose your moment for engaging in the
encounter. This means you may interrupt an NPC (and the DM!) at any
point during a social encounter with no penalty in an effort to drive
the course of the encounter. This interruption comes at no penalty for
interrupting, although there may be consequence to what is said or
done as a result of interrupting.  Alternatively, you may declare your
intent not to respond immediately to social encounter, instead waiting
to see what all other parties – NPCs and PCs – do in the moment before
taking action.

Charming Song
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 3rd level your force of personality overwhelms those around you.
Your song acts as the Charm Person spell a number of times equal to
your proficiency modifier without using spell slots. This ability
resets after a long rest. Like the spell, this performance requires
concentration.

Song of Confusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 6th level, you are able to muddy the thoughts of those around you, leaving them unsure of where they are or what they are doing. You may perform this song as an action. This performance targets on humanoid creature with the Confusion spell without using spell slots.

This may be performed a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier and resets after a long rest.

Confounding Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At 14th level, you are able to literally change the memories of those
around you through song. You can spend a bardic inspiration to target
an individuals equal to your proficiency modifier who are within 60
feet and can hear your performance. This performance has the same
effect as the Modify Memory spell with the same saving throw.
Additional individuals can be targeted by the same performance at a
cost of one additional bardic inspiration per target.  Higher levels
of Modify Memory (normally involving use of a higher spell slot) are
achieved by spending an additional bardic inspiration per target.

When targeting multiple individuals, the memory modification is the
same for each target.  That is, each charmed target will have their
memory of the same event modified in the same by the performance,
albeit in a way appropriate to the experience of each target.

As with the casting of the modify memory spell, the song of the
performance is used to describe the new memories. The performance must
last uninterrupted for at least one full minute and for as long
(determined by the DM) as it takes to fully describe the new memories.
