Introducing The Broken World to the DM
======================================

The Broken World is sprawling setting.  While there is an over-arching
narrative to the campaign, there is ample room for side quests,
for alternate objectives, and for other stories to be told.

Lore
----

540 years ago, Pelor the Sun god and Gruumsh the orcish war god
argued.  Again.  It was a long-standing enmity between the two.  Over
the aeons, Pelor and Gruumsh had crossed swords many, many, many
times.  No one living -- mortal or god -- knows what prompted their
final conflict, but it was different.  They killed one another. In an
instant, two essential divine roles were vacant.

In the ensuing chaos, the other gods quickly split into three camps:

#. those who wanted to quell the chaos and return to the status quo,
#. those who wanted to avail themselves of the chaos, to change the
   status quo, and to find new roles in the divine order, and
#. those who chose to sit out the conflict, expecting that that
   moment, like all moments throughout the long aeons of existence,
   would soon pass.

The Godswar
~~~~~~~~~~~

Sides were chosen...

Orcus and The Raven Queen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One prominent god in the second camp was Orcus, Demon God of Undeath.
Mounting the back mythical Terrasque as a steed and commanding a vast
army of undead creatures, Orcus tore his way into material world.

Opposing Orcus was a prominent god in the first camp, The Raven Queen,
goddess of passage and natural death.

Orcus and the Raven Queen fought fiercely.  In time, the tide began to
turn to Orcus and his armies.  In one desperate measure, The Raven
Queen rallied her power, drawing a massive lightning bolt from the
heavens, slaying the Terrasque.  

The slaying of the Terrasque might not have been enough, except that
events were moving swiftly elsewhere in the world and two other events
happened at the same moment that The Raven Queen called down her
lightning bolt.

The Aboleth's Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deep beneath ocean waves, an ancient aboleth recognized the 



The Unlikely Alliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Moradin, dwarvish god of the forge
+ Luthic the Cave Mother, orcish goddess of hearth and healing
+ Lathander, god of the dawn, now known as Lathander the Lost
+ Umberlee, goddess of sea and storms
+ Corelon Larethian, elvish god of magic, art, and poetry

Grieving the loss of her husband Gruumsh, but also recognizing a
moment of opportunity free for the first time in aeons from his
dominating presence, Luthic conceived a plan to quell the chaos and
destruction looking in the unfolding Godswar.  Luthic approached
Moradin, her husband's ancient foe.  Impressed by the possibility of
peace between their peoples and by the boldness of Luthic's plan in
the face of the current danger, Moradin joined Luthic to recruit the
other members of their impromptu cabal, a group of deities that came
to be know as The Unlikely Alliance.

In short order, Luthic and Moradin found common cause with a wildly
diverse set of gods. Before they could act, the confounding events of
the aboleth's gambit and of the fight between Orcus and the Raven
Queen.  The ensuing escalation of the crisis force the five gods to
improvise.

Seeing the beginnings of the world-shattering moment, Umberlee and
Lathander implemented a plan to preserve some inhabitable space for
the mortals surviving the calamity.  Umberlee created base structure
of thousands of floating islands constructed from the bare earth of
the world, all floating above a collection of all the world's waters.
Lathander created the 13 Trees to provide a space for culture,
knowledge, and memory to thrive even after the destruction.  Corelon
Larethian offered the vast reservoir of magic at his disposal as a god
of the Elves to power the work of work of Unmberlee and Latethian.

Luthic and Moradin took a step back, allowing the other three gods to
work their magics.  Once
