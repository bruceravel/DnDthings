The Broken World
================

A long-term campaign starting at level 1.

This is a world of islands floating in the air, of city-size trees,
and of airships that travel among them.  

This used to be a normal world, a big ball with a moon orbiting a sun,
with oceans and continents, with all sorts of fantastic people and
even more fantastic creature living in every corner.

Then, one day, 540 years ago, everything changed.  Gods fought gods
and the world broke.

When the dust settled from calamity, nations were broken.  Literally
broken in the sense that chunks of inhabited land were now floating in
an endless cloudy expanse.  All the people living on these remaining
pieces of the world carried on as best they could.

Today, ancient dangers are stirring again and The Broken World needs
heroes.
