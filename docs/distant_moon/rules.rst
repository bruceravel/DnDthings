House rules
===========

#. |checkbox| No safety tools will be used at the start of the game.
   If, at any time, a player would like to use a safety tool, please
   ask.  See https://ttrpgsafetytoolkit.com/.  That said, we will
   discuss lines and veils at the beginning of the first game.

#. |checkbox| PVP combat initiated by players is a hard no for this DM.

#. |checkbox| Alignment doesn't matter.  Players don't need to play
   paladins, but they should their moral compass should point in the
   generally forward direction.  I refuse to DM a murder-hobo game.

#. |checkbox| Encumbrance doesn't matter ... within reason.  If you
   want to haul off the entire 30,000 gp from a dragon hoard, you have
   to explain how you are doing that.

#. |checkbox| Flanking is not used in combat.

#. |checkbox| Magical effects that cause involuntary movement on the
   battle field trigger attacks of opportunity.  This includes things
   like repelling blast, Grasp of Hadar, or the telekinesis spell.

#. |checkbox| Skill check rolls:

   + When the DM asks for a skill check, all players roll.

   + When a PC asks to make a skill check and the situation suggests
     the check applies to the entire group, only one player may make
     the check.  Other PCs may assist if *proficient* in the skill.
     If proficient, the PC making the check may add the skill check
     modifier of the assisting PC to their roll.  This is to avoid the
     situation of the party spamming a skill check to get the result
     they want.

   + Some skill checks might be rolled by the DM if there is narrative
     merit to the player not knowing the result of the roll.

#. |checkbox| Position of your mini on the battle map matters.  If you
   don't move your mini, your PC hasn't moved.

#. |checkbox| Movement using a ruler is preferred over movement by
   counting spaces on a square grid.  This avoids confusion over how
   to count diagonals.

#. |checkbox| Players start each session with a hero point.  The hero
   point can be used for almost anything:

   + re-roll a bad roll
   + make the DM re-roll a good roll
   + stabilize when making death saves
   + place something in a scene (within reason)

   Hero points may also be awarded for doing something cool or
   surprising during play.

   Hero points expire at the end of a session.  The *do not* stack
   between sessions.
