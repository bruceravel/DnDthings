River Boat
==========

.. admonition:: Chapter overview

   Connect with the Dreamwalker while sleeping.  Walk to the river.
   Meet a quehen.  Share a meal with the quehen. Book passage on the
   riverboat.  Survive the boat journey.

The players got instructions back in Riverun to head towards the
larger mountain range.  The ravine is about 18 hours of walking, so
that they have to camp at least once.

Contact from the Dreamwalker
----------------------------

When they bunk down, give anyone who wants it an opportunity to make a
DC 10 WIS save against opening their dreams to the Dreamwalker.  If
everyone opts to roll and passes, then they get no information.  They
are simply stranded on an alien planet with no information.

If everyone opts to roll some/all fail, then the Dreamwalker gives
them just enough information to keep going.  Play up the distance and
scratchiness of the Dreamwalker's words telling them "Head to the
river.  Book passage to Ssillissoz Village.  Ask around and you will
find me"

Anyone who opts not roll will be able to have a real conversation with
the Dreamwalker.  She will give instructions to for how to find her.
If pressed she will talk about the dangers of the river and urge the
party to be polite and politic with the river guide.  "Queens" are a
little quick to insult if they feel they are not being respected.

In short (these are all things the Dreamwalker might tell the party):

+ She is in the town of Ssillissoz, which can be found down-river from
  their current location.
+ The river in question flows through the ravine which can be seen
  from the mountain top.
+ The path to the river is simple |nd| follow the road the down from the
  mountain top and heading in the direction of the ravine.
+ The road will end at the ravine, where the party will find a
  riverboat terminus.
+ The terminus is a lonely place.  The only building is the shack that
  houses the quehen pilot during their time waiting for the tide to
  arrive for the return river trip.
+ Although not the preferred mode of payment, the pilot will accept
  jewels of gold |nd| 5gp per person.
+ It is a long and dangerous walk along the ravine, although the party
  will arrive in about 10 days if they choose to do so.

The Dreamwalker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Dreamwalker is a half-elf named Anya Varothian.  While not much of
an adventurer, Anya is an accomplished empath and psionic with a
specific affinity for contacting sleeping minds over vast distances.

Anya volunteered for the first mission to Jarn soon after the
construction of the portal in the Sanctuary of Lathander back in
Riverun.  Along with a party of two dwarf fighters, Bonstock and
Grinya Silvervein, and a human Paladin of Lathander, Jimmer Cooper,
Anya's mission was to set up an outpost in a promising community on
Jarn.  She would be the greeter and conveyor of news and information
for subsequent parties arriving through the portal.  She was also
tasked to obtain intelligence about the existence of and operations of
whatever parties are working on resurrecting the Godslayer.

After a couple difficult months of wandering blindly throughout this
strange moon, Anya and her friends found refuge in the town of
Ssillissoz, a mixed community of the four main species on Jarn.

This arrangement suited Anya very well.  Her main motivation for
volunteering for the mission was very well served by this location.
Her psionic sensitivities made life among like-minded creatures
difficult.  The continuous low-level contact with human, elf, and
half-elf minds was a source of constant, low-level stress.  In her
experience, it was easier to spend time among communities of more
distant creatures.  

She spent many years as a diplomat, taking posts in gnomish, orcish,
bugbear, and other communities.  She had even lead several delegations
to parlay with metallic and chromatic dragons.  Leaving our world to
work in a place with no humans or elves seemed like a plumb assignment
to Anya.

Once in Ssillissoz, she quickly learned to speak Jarn Common and found
close friendships among each of the four species.  After a couple
months, she had used her diplomatic experience to join the town council
and work on communications with trading caravans and off-world
visitors.  All the while, she maintained discipline in probing for
visitors through the portal, a discipline she is now using for only
the second time.

This calm, sedentary life was not to the liking of the Silverveins.
These married dwarven couple were intrigued by this new world and
quickly succumbed to wanderlust.  The last Anya heard, they had
mounted an expedition to Jarn's cold side to do a bit of ice hunting
and investigate the history of ancient mining activities related to
magical oars and gems that are only found on that side of the moon.


.. admonition:: Aside
   :class: sidebar note

   The hoon brought a single Traeki ring with them.  This ring was
   intended to produce antibiotics helpful for Jimmer.  It was also
   accumulating medical and chemical knowledge about the human form
   for consumption by Traeki medical personnel back in Ssillissoz.
   This knowledge, along with years of knowing Anya, makes the Traeki
   much more prepared to help the party ... well, the human or
   half-human members of the party.

Jimmer, the Paladin, was injured in an encounter with a glyptodon that
had strayed far from its herd.  His injuries were confounding to the
skilled Traeki healers, due to their unfamiliarity with human
physiology.  A group of hoon rangers accompanied Jimmer back to the
mountaintop portal, but by the time they arrived, Jimmers injuries
were quite severely infected, even with the benefit of Traeki potions.

About eight months after settling in Ssillissoz, Anya had her first
task as a Dreamwalker.  The authorities back in Riverun sent a second
party through the portal.  By this time, Anya had learned of a group
of off-world drow who had arrived in the most recent transportation
window and set up shop in a distant, mostly Ursic town called
Ssonnissov.  Anya tried once to contact one of these drow in his
sleep.  She quickly broke contact when it became clear that the drow
know exactly what was going on, had sophisticated mental defenses in
place, and very much wanted to know where on the planet he might find
something so amazing as a dreamwalker.

The drow were rumored to be asking questions about a nameless, extinct
volcano deep into a region called The Blight known to the locals as
Ember's Sorrow.  This seemed like a lead, so Anya sent the second
expedition to investigate.  She kept in touch with that group via
dreams for several weeks before loosing contact.  She eventually
learned from a trading caravan about a running fight through the
streets of Ssonnissov between two outworlder groups with the group
that had been in town for some time slaying the new arrivals.

Anya reported this back to Riverun via the difficult chore of
dreamwalking though an open portal.  Such communications require a
psionically sensitive sleeper on the other end much effort on Anya's
part.  In this way, she was only able to report on the broad outline
of the fates of the second expedition.

She has been waiting for the third expedition and, armed with more
intelligence on activities across Jarn, has a new idea for where to
send the third expedition.

Meeting the pilot
-----------------

Upon arrival at the edge of the ravine, the party finds the following
scene:

+ The last kilometer of the road runs along the edge of a marshland
+ Near the ravine, the marshes turn into a swampy, murky, shallow
  lake. In the center of the lake, there is an island.  At its center
  is a mound, obviously constructed, with several tunnels emptying out
  onto the island.
+ A small but well constructed wooden hut on thee edge of the lake
  with the front porch looking out over the ravine.
+ On a platform next to the ravine, there is a metal mechanical device
  with intricate gearing and metal cables.  The cabling runs up and
  out on a metal arm that extends over the edge of the ravine.  The
  metal cable hangs down from the metal arm and extends into the
  ravine.
+ On a second platform is a cross between an enormous starfish and a
  crab.  The crab creature is propped up on three of its feet and is
  holding a wooden pole with the other two feet.  The pole seems to be
  a fishing rod.  The fishing line extends down into the ravine.

The crab-like creature is, of course, the quehen pilot.  She is fishing
to bide her time and to have a nice lunch.  Her name in Jarn common is
Swift Current.  She is a commoner with a high dexterity.

Like any quehen, she is hard to sneak up on, particularly given that
there is not much cover close to the house.  She will reel in her
fishing line, set the pole down on the platform, and stand low on all
fives before addressing the party.  She will speak in quehen accented
(very clacky noise from rods hitting the interior of her shell) Jarl
common before making a rocking gesture (quehen shrug) and switching to
telepathy. 

The party will hear a voice in their minds: "I see you are coming from
the mountain.  You must be off-worlders coming through the portal.
Welcome to Jarn."

Swift Current will answer most any question truthfully in unguarded
language.  She is the pilot of the boat to Ssillissoz.  The tide will
bee rising is about 12 hours.  She will ask for paper currency, which
the party will not have.  She'll accept 5gp worth of gold or a small
gem as payment per person as well.  She'll say that she isn't
expecting any other passengers although t here is always the chance
that a straggler might arrive just before departure.  She will offer
them a meal of roasted fish and a stew of insects and tubers.  (The
food all tastes odd and fairly spicy, but tasty.)

The boat and boat launch mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ravine is about 200 feet across, with the other side at about the
same level as the ground on this side.  It really is just a trench cut
by geology and hydrology through surrounding landscape.

The mechanical object described above is a crane used to raise and
lower the river boat.  It is a mechanical winch powered by an arcanic
battery.  The battery recharges during the ~36 hours between tides by
exposure to emanations from Esta Kareki.

The boat is a sort of prolate spheroid with stubby, retractable
wings.  It is hanging about 25 feet above the water level, which is
about 50 feet below the ground level.  It will be hauled up to ground
level for boarding.  There is a retractable part of the platform
under the crane which is used as a gang plank.

The main entrance into the boat is fairly large |nd| it has to
accommodate quehens and large traeki, after all.  Inside there are
various kinds of seats/restraints which unfold from the walls and
floors and which are sized for the four races.  The hoonish restraints
are the closest in form and function for the party (unless the party
has someone quite odd).  For small-sized party members, Swift Current
will produce some padded strapping material which can be used to
secure party members to one of the seat types.

When it comes time to launch, Swift Current will become increasingly
concerned about time.  Her strong preference is to get everyone
settled in and the boat down on the water with about 10 minutes to
spare.


The launch
~~~~~~~~~~

This river ride is kind of an A-ticket ride.  Due to the gravitational
attraction of Esta Kareki and the rocking of Jarn about its tide
locked position, there are massive tidal shifts of water all over the
planet.  River beds are mostly ravines like this one and are deep
enough to manage massive changes in the height of the water level.

At this point in the broad plane between the nearby mountain ranges,
the surge will bring the water height to within 5 feet of the top of
the ravine.  The river boat is designed to ride the tidal surge,
carrying the boat about 150 miles downstream in the course of about 2
hours.  The initial acceleration is exhilarating, to say the least.
The rush of water brings the boat from standing still to cruising
speed of about 75 miles per hour in about seven stomach-tumbling
seconds.

The party should make a DC 12 CON check to avoid vomiting.  No real
adverse effect, other than a mess that will smell bad and need to be
cleaned up.  But it is always fun to make the party sweat a bit.

The boat is designed to ride the initial surge over the crest and to
settle into the swell of the secondary surge, which it rides all the
way to the port about 2 miles upstream of Ssillissoz.

This encounter is designed to be a light social encounter.  If the
party simply cooperates with Swift Current, nothing happens.  They
have a nice, if somewhat cramped river boat trip for a couple hours.
The challenge of this encounter is with an anti-social party.  Some
possible scenarios:

#. The party is offensive or non-communicative with Swift Current.  In
   that case, she will simply refuse to take them and the party will
   spend 10 days walking to Ssillissoz.
#. Swift Current intends to return to Ssillissoz.  If the encounter
   turns ugly, she will lower the boat to water level and high dive
   into the water (something she is very capable of, even from 50
   feet).  She will  then use the bottom entrance into the boat and
   navigate it out to the middle of the river to wit for the surge.
#. The party kills Swift Current and decides to walk.
#. The party kills Swift Current and decides to ride the boat or
   otherwise commandeers the boat from Swift Current.  In that case,
   the party has to try to figure out navigation.

If the party walks instead of plays nice with the social encounter,
throw frequent and difficult random encounters at them.  This
encounter is meant to be easy if approached sociably and deadly if
done anti-sociably.

The much more deadly is to have the party attempt to navigate the
boat.  To be clear, this is alien technology, designed to be operated
by a quehen, and designed to navigate an exceedingly dangerous tidal
surge.  Every check should be DC18 or higher.

Among the checks:

+ INT to recognize that the boat has limited self-propulsion.  In the
  absence of the tidal surge, it would take longer to ride the boat
  down the river than it would be to walk to Ssillissoz.
+ INT to determine the operation of the controls.
+ INT to determine the operation of instruments monitoring water level.
+ INT to recognize that things need to happen once the water starts to
  rise.
+ DEX if the boat has not been released from the cable. In that case,
  the water surge will tear apart an emergency release, lurching the
  boat violently.  The DEX is to avoid getting thrown around the
  cabin.  Anyone strapped in will need a CON save to avoid bludgeoning
  injury from the straps.
+ INT by the "pilot" to determine how to how to respond to the surge /
  breaking of the cable, followed by 
+ DEX to do the right thing.
+ Subsequent INT and DEX saves to recognize the adjustments to be made
  when riding over the crest of the initial surge, then to settle into
  the trough of the secondary surge.


Once the water starts moving, frequent DEX saves will be needed by
anyone not strapped in to stay on their feet.  

Bludgeoning damage is severe each time a check is failed: 8d8
bludgeoning.

Failed INT checks in the early stages should increase later INT saves
as they would represent damage to the boat or its controls.

A bad INT/DEX save once the water hit has a chance of breaking the
boat apart.  If that happens, apply more bludgeoning damage, followed
by swim checks in turbulent water.  Players in armor will sink.
Players that manage to swim will find themselves in a steep walled
canyon with no place to rest and in bone chilling water.

Do NOT be afraid to TPK the party if they try the anti-social route.

But also do not be afraid to reward the party of they figure out a way
this humble adventure path author cannot think of to survive the boat
ride.


.. admonition:: Author's motivation

   This encounter is inspired by my good friend Jonathon who is a
   maniac at the D&D table.  He is unfailingly hostile to NPCs.  In
   one campaign, he was desperate to commandeer the airship his party
   was flying on.  I talked him out of doing so in the interest of
   keeping the campaign moving forward.  In retrospect, that was a
   rookie DM mistake.  I should have let him do what he wanted and
   pivoted the campaign to the consequence.  In this encounter |nd|
   early in the campaign when people should not yet be too invested in
   their characters |nd| the "pivot" is towards a TPK.  Hmmm... I have
   never DMed a TPK...


Arrival in Ssillissoz
---------------------

After a couple hours, Swift Current will bring the boat into dock.  A
cable will descend from a crane similar to the one at the other end of
the trip.  It will attach to the top of the boat and lift it up to the
top of the ravine.  Swift Current will wish the players well, point
them in the direction of town, and state that he needs to do an hours
worth of work to prepare the boat for it's trip back up river.



The walking route
-----------------

There is a winding road from Ssillissoz to the boat terminus that
loosely follows the ravine.  While the desert region seemed flat when
viewed from the mountain top, there is a lot of local topography.  The
road winds through rocky terrain, mesas, and hills.  It sometimes gets
as far as 5 miles away from the river.

Water is non-trivial to come by.  While there is plenty of water in
the river, it spends most of the time about 50 feet down from the edge
of the ravine.  Every day and half, the surge comes by, bringing lots
of water within 5 or 10 feet of the ravine edge.  Beyond that, the
players will need to explain how they are getting their water and the
DM will have to decide how hazardous that is.

The walking trip will take 10 days.  Each day, you should roll for a
random encounter.  These encounters should be challenging fights or
threatening environmental hazards.  They probably shouldn't be obvious
TPK situations, but they should make the players regret not being
friendly back at the boat launch.


.. note::
   Need a table of random encounters, eg

   + a stray glyptodon
   + some kind of insect monster attack
   + an environmental effect, maybe marshlands with quicksand
   + a aerial attack, maybe pteranodons
   + roll twice for two encounters in a day
   + etc
