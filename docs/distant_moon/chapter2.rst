River Boat
==========

.. admonition:: Chapter overview

   Connect with the Dreamwalker while sleeping.  Walk to the river.
   Meet a quehn.  Share a meal with the quehn. Book passage on the
   riverboat.  Survive the boat journey.

The players got instructions back in Riverun to head towards the
larger mountain range.  The ravine is about 18 hours of walking, so
that they have to camp at least once.

Contact from the Dreamwalker
----------------------------

When they bunk down, give anyone who wants it an opportunity to make a
DC 10 WIS save against opening their dreams to the Dreamwalker.  If
everyone opts to roll and passes, then they get no information.  They
are simply stranded on an alien planet with no information.

If everyone opts to roll some/all fail, then the Dreamwalker gives
them just enough information to keep going.  Play up the distance and
scratchiness of the Dreamwalker's words telling them "Head to the
river.  Book passage to Ssillissoz Village.  Ask around and you will
find me"

Anyone who opts not roll will be able to have a real conversation with
the Dreamwalker.  She will give instructions to for how to find her.
If pressed she will talk about the dangers of the river and urge the
party to be polite and politic with the river guide.  "Queens" are a
little quick to insult if they feel they are not being respected.
