   A sword I like.

.. card:: Warder

   A greatsword with runes etched along the length of the blade.

   This greatsword has three charges which can be used to cast the
   protection from evil and good spell once per charge.  This takes an
   action.  Like the spell, this lasts for 10 minutes.  Like the
   spell, this requires concentration saves (CON vs DC 10 or DC 1/2
   damage, whichever is larger).  The charges refresh at dawn.

   **Protection from Evil and Good**: Creatures of type aberration,
   celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, and undead have disadvantage on
   attack roles and cannot charm, frighten, or possess you.  If
   under any of those conditions and capable of taking the action to
   activate Warder's effect, subsequent saving throws against the
   relevant effect have advantage.

   Crimson starting item.  Gift from her mom's mentor.


.. card:: Ring of Dimension Door

   This simple platinum ring is sized for a creature of the size of a
   goliath, although it does not need to be worn on a finger to be
   used.  It merely requires attunement.  When attuned, it can be used
   once to cast the dimension door spell.  once used, the ring
   crumbles into dust.

.. card:: Not quite perfect liar's dice

   This pair of six sided dice have a powerful but dangerous
   enchantment cast upon them.  When cast with your right hand, they
   role normally.  When cast with your left hand, you get advantage on
   the roll |nd| roll 2d6 twice and take the better roll.

   However, if you roll boxcars, the enchantment is very obvious.
   Your opponent will notice the dice land on a 2 and 4, then
   conspicuously roll over onto their six sides, making it
   abundantly clear that you have been cheating.

   Gaiseric starting item


.. card:: Escapee artist's belt

   This is a narrow length of sack cloth with frayed ends normally
   worn as a belt.  While worn, it grants the wearer advantage on
   rolls to escape a physical grapple or entanglement.  This works on
   the physical result of a spell, such as grappling vines.  It has no
   effect on a direct magical effect (e.g. hold person) nor on
   paralysis or petrification.  Ambiguous situations are ruled at DM's
   discretion.

   Gaiseric starting item

.. card:: Five Arrows of Transposition

   Using an attack action, this arrow can be fired at a position.
   Where it hits, the archer will be teleported to that position.

   The range is the range of the weapon used to fire the arrow.

   Roll an attack roll vs. DC12.  On a hit, the archer is teleported
   exactly into position.  On a miss, the the archer is teleported to
   random position (roll a d8) 15 feet from the target.  On a natural
   1, the archer is teleported to a position of the DM's discretion.
