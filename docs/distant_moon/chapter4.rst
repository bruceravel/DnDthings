A Train Ride
============

.. admonition:: Chapter overview

   Leave Ssillissoz on a train.  Curvy tracks.  An attempted train
   heist.  Arrival in Galooon.

After a few days in Ssillissoz, word comes that the train will be
arriving in a few hours. This train will stop at Galooon about 36
hours later.

The plan, as laid out by Anya is to get off in Galooon and ask around
for directions to the Bluest Grove, a large expanse of forest not far
from the town.  Crossing the Bluest Grove will lead the party in the
hinterlands of the Blight, a remote, infrequently traveled region
which is the subject of considerable legend and superstition.

Once in the blight, the Fireflow mountain range should be clearly
visible in the distance.  The traeki sage In Go Tin Pok lives in the
foothills of the Fireflows in a tower that should be findable. 

Anya has not been to any of these places.  No on in Ssillissoz will be
found who has.  Some good social skills and decent rolls should find
someone in Galooon who can provide some more guidance.

The train ride
--------------

The train will cost the equivalent of 15 gp per person.  That will get
a seat in the hoon section of the passenger car.

Three of the train's four (other than the engine) cars are filled
with trade goods: lumber, preserved foods, arts and crafts, metal
tools, mail, and a magically sealed safe filled with the magical
crystals that are used to make batteries like the one powering the
train.

Train staff (all commoners):

+ Urs pilot (high INT)
+ Urs co-pilot (high WIS)
+ Hoon engineer (high INT and DEX)
+ Traeki engineer tending the batteries (very high INT, high DEX)
+ Quehen purser managing the passengers (high CHA)
+ Hoon teamsetr (high STR and CON)
+ Hoon teamster (high STR and CON)

.. note::
  
   Need names for the staff members

Other passengers:

.. note::
  
   Figure out the passenger situation.  Should be 10 or so other hoon,
   urs, and quehen.  Probably no traeki.



Twelve hours will pass without incident as the train runs a fairly
straight and level rail.  The second twelve hours will be more
interesting.

The anti-social scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the players attempt to commandeer the train, they will.  They can
easily overpower the 7 commoners on board, although the hoons will
fight as best as they can.

If they commandeer the train, ask for plans.  Any plan that involves
trying to understand the train controls will be very difficult,
requiring many checks.  Assume that the party is working together, so
don't allow independent checks for each roll.  Ask someone to take the
lead and give someone a chance to aid.  Primary INT checks will all be
DC 18 to figure out the purpose of something or how it works.  Aid
checks are DC 15 and will allow the primary to add the aider's INT
bonus.

Things that might need checks:

+ How to slow the train down
+ How to speed the train up
+ The meanings of various indicators (speed, power from batteries,
  weather, track signals indicating speed changes)

Space the checks out in an attempt to build tension.

The coming threat is a section of track where the speed of the train
must be significantly reduced to avoid derailing on a dangerous bend.
The party will need to somehow recognize the track signals indicating
the coming speed zone, then they will need to reduce speed enough to
make the bend safely.  There should be multiple checks throughout this
to see if the train is actually going slowly enough to be safe.

If the train is moving too fast, it will derail.  The resulting crash
will ruin the train and much of the cargo.  It will kill any remaining
staff and all but two or three passengers.

The party will each take 12d6 bludgeoning damage.  Anyone who loses
more than 1/2 their HP in the crash must roll a DC 12 CON save.  On a
fail, roll a D10 and resolve the injury on `this table

        weeks of rest, or when you receive at least 50 points of
        magical healing. A DC 20 Medicine check with a Healer's Kit
        can be used to halve the remaining recovery time.

	
.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card::  8, Internal bruising

       You have vulnerability to bludgeoning, force, and thunder
       damage. This heals after 4 weeks of rest, or when you receive
       at least 50 points of magical healing.
			 
    .. grid-item-card::  10, Concusion

       You have disadvantage on Wis and Int checks, as well as Con
       saves to maintain concentration. This heals after 4 weeks of
       rest, or when you receive at least 50 points of magical
       healing.


This scenario has several consequences.  First, there are a few
remaining passengers who will be pissed and untrusting.

Second, they are stranded at the halfway point of the journey and are
a long way away from anywhere.  A very small community of Urs will be
found after about 3 days walking.  A town with a traeki healer is
another 2 days.

Third, the party will run into the bandits described below.  If they
wait with the train, the bandits will attack at the train after
waiting for some members of the party to bed down.  If they are
walking, they will come across the bandits walking in the opposite
direction.  In either case, they will have to fight, possibly with
unhealed injuries. 


Bandit Encounter
----------------

The chapter has our first planned combat encounter with a band of 5 or
6 natives, 2 fighters, a monk, and 2 or 3 rogues.  Thee guys know
their tactics and, even though they are lower level than the party,
they should be a genuine challenge.

The pro-social scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the train ride goes smoothly, this encounter will happen about 18
hours into the trip.  The train will be on a long straight and will
begin to slow down eventually coming to a stop in front of a blockage
on the tracks.  The three hoons will disembark to take a look with the 
quehen purser asking everyone to stay in place while the staff
investigates.

One of the hoons will be shot and killed, followed by two yelps of
surprise.  Then an ursic voice |nd| obviously enhanced by thaumaturgy
|nd| will say "Leave personal valuables and the train's safe by the
side of the track and you will be left to clear the track and be on
your way."  (This is a feint for the PCs.  There is no spell caster.
The boss is using a magic device.

If the party tries to stay out of the whole deal, they will be noticed
by one of the bandits.  This will result in the boss using her device
to bellow out, "Send the stinking elves out or we'll enter the train
and start killing everyone."

Bottom line, make the fight happen.


The anti-social scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming the party heads down the tracks in the direction of Galooon,
a couple days after the crash, the bandits will come looking for the
train.  They will spot the party during a rest and try to set up an
ambush. 

Bottom line, the fight happens.



The bandit party
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

6 members of the band, 2 Urs, 3 hoon, 1 quehen

These guys have tactics.  The two fighters and the monk will each
advance.  The two ranged rogues will hang back and hit with sneak
attack.  The stabby rogue will move around, availing herself off
mobile to avoid AOOs.  They will fight until two are down, then try to
retreat.

Loot
~~~~


The loot from this fight will be a bit disappointing.  

Together, the bandits have 50 keys worth of paper currency.

Except for the quehen, they all have nice leather armor.  However it
is sized and shaped for urs and hoon, so not much use to the party.
Also, none of it is magical.  It can, however, be gathered and sold in
Galooon for local currency.  The lot will get them 100 keys (which
will go about as far as 300 gp due to exchange rates).

The two ranged weapons are also less than useful, but obviously
interesting.  The urs double bow is an amazing piece of engineering
that could be sold to a gnome or dwarf back home for a very pretty
penny or locally for 35 keys.  None of the party will be able to use
it as it is a four-handed weapon.

The hand crossbow could probably be modified to be used, basically by
including some padding to accommodate the much larger forarm of a
hoon.

The boss has an arcanic communication stone.  The other side of this
stone is back at the bandits base and will be answered by a traeki.
If the traeki gets wind of the demise of his crew, he will sell his
services to the Drow in the final act, giving them a heads up about
the party.

If the party cuts into the corpse of the quehen, they will find a ring
that he swallowed some time in the past.  This ring grants a one-time
use of dimension door, which he will use if the call to retreat has
happened and he is the last person standing.  This ring is a secret,
his companions do not know that he has it.  Once used, this ring
crumbles to dust.



Rest of the trip
----------------

Heroes are heroes.  After a few hours in Galooon everyone knows who
the outworlders are and are favorably inclined towards them
