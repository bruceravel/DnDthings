The World of Jarn
=================

All of the action except for the introductory session takes place on
Jarn.  Jarn is a habitable moon orbiting a ringed gas giant.  It is
somewhere very far away from our world.  The magic portal in the
basement of the Sanctuary of Lathander is capable of transporting
people to virtually any location in all the realms.  For our
adventure, it sent our heroes to some far-away planet, but still on
the Prime Material Plane.

A Brief History of Jarn
-----------------------

Jarn is much inspired by the techno-magical setting of Starfinder.  It
is a world where space travel happens (although there will be scant
evidence of that in our adventure), but magic is also very real.  Jarn
and its parent planet are a very magical place.  So much so that space
travel to Jarn is infrequent and dependent on certain mystical and
planetary alignments.  At other times, Jarn is pretty isolated.

Jarn's isolation means that this is mostly a high fantasy, D&D
setting.  It is not really a sci-fi setting, although some
technological elements will be seen.  The river boat in chapter 2 and
the train in chapter 4 are examples of this.  Guns will make an
appearance in chapter 5, but are used very sparsely.

The remoteness of Jarn allows the easy lifting of concepts -- along
with creatures -- from David Brin's Uplift Storm trilogy.  The Quehns,
Hoon, Urs, and Traeki are on Jarn for the essentially same reason they
are on the planet first seen in Brightness Reef.  Those four species
are escapees/retirees from whatever space faring society exists beyond
this solar system.  Jarn is a place people and races can come to be in
a minimally technological society.  No one the adventurers encounter
until arcanic scientists in the last chapter has any real notion of
what lies beyond Jarn and it's solar system.

Jarn is a lighter-gravity world that our world.  The players will feel
the 80-ish% gravity noticeably.  All players will get an additional 10
feet of movement (as will many of the opponents in encounters).  Monks
will  get an additional 15 feet.  However, when things are moving very
fast or if the players need to do something involving athletics or
acrobatics that would reasonably be affected by the lower gravity,
don't hesitate to impose a high DC or even disadvantage on the roll.

Jarn's sky is ... disconcerting.  It is a uniform sort of pinkish hue
and dominated by the gigantic, purple, ringed orb of its parent
planet, Esta Kareki.  This adventure takes place during Jarn's long
day when it is on the sunward side of the planet and receiving robust
illumination from the solar-induced luminescence of the planet.  There
is also a long night |nd| winter, effectively |nd| when Jarn is on the
far side of the planet from the sun.  There is still glow from the
planet, but much less.  There is not a day/night cycle.  Society on
Jarn spreads its "nighttime" activities |nd| sleep and such |nd|
across all hours in ways that will be mysterious to the players.  It
is incumbent upon the players to choose times to rest and to find
safe, comfortable places to do so.

Jarn's flora and fauna are similarly weird.  Trees are mostly blue.
Insects exist in all shapes and sizes and are the primary source of
food for most of the people.  There are vertebrates of all varieties
also, but many of them are big and mean.  Example: the dinosaurs in
chapter 5.  Insects are just more manageable.

.. attention::

   Tidally locked.  Terminator.  Dark side.  Big cities outside this
   adventure.  Money printed at banks.  Gold is no one's favorite.


The Races of Jarn
-----------------

The Quehen, Hoon, Urs, and Traeki of this adventure are similer to
those from Brin's novels, but adapted a bit for D&D.

The stats given below are for villager adults.  All four races can be
NPC of any class or level.  Mechanically, these should be treated as
playable races.

All four races |nd| indeed any NPC encountered on Jarn |nd| speak Jarn
common.  Jarn common is a language that has evolved to be understood
and spoken by creatures possessing a wide variety of vocalization
apparatuses.  It will, at first, take players some time (or a very
high roll) to recognize that all NPCs are speaking the same language.

The Quehen
~~~~~~~~~~

Quehen are large, 5-fold-symmetric crab-like creatures.  They have a
thick, star-shaped, chitonous shell covering the top of their bodies
with thinner, cartilaginous plates on their underside.  They are
semi-aquatic, living in dens built into the ground near rivers and
lakes, and equally happy on land or under water.

Quehen have a sensory organ in the center of their body shaped like a
dome with optical and auditory sensors pointing in all directions.
This dome can be retracted into their bodies for sleep or protection,
but doing so greatly limits their ability to see or hear.

They have multi jointed legs at each corner of their body.  There is
hip-like joint that rotates through almost 180 degrees.  When standing
normally on land, the knee-joint is raised above the body.  The hip
can rotate and the knee extend, raising the body about two feet higher
off the ground.  Each leg ends in an ankle like joint connected to
three mutually opposable, crab-leg-like fingers which are used to
manipulate tools.

They speak using a complex series of chitous rods attached to
trigger-like musculature just beneath the thick upper shell.  These
beat against shell in complex speech patterns.

Quehen are also natural telepaths using the same mechanics at
Thri-Kreen.

The Hoon
~~~~~~~~

The Hoon look somewhat like gnolls, but with much less prominent
snouts.  They are bulky and broad-shouldered, covered in brown, black,
or grey fur. They have muscular arms ending in hands with 3 fingers
and an opposable thumb. They have stout legs with two counter-bending
knees and legs ending in broad paws.

Hoon cubs walk on all fours when very young.  Older cubs will revert
to knuckle walking when startled or in a particular hurry.  Adults
bound in the light gravity of Jarn using their multi-jointed lags as a
sort of spring.

Hoon have deep, loud, booming voices due to barrel chests and a sort
of inflatable pouch on their necks.  This pouch gives a broad vocal
range, making hoon popular singers and performing artists in Jarn
communities.

The Urs
~~~~~~~

Urs are centaur-like creatures with long snake-like necks extending
from a body that resembles a slender, half-sized, horse.  Their snouts
end in four prehensile, opposable lips capable of manipulating tools
and aiding in whistle-y vocalization. They have tree eyes arranged
around their snouts.  Olfactory sensors are under their lips.

Along with four hoofed legs, Urs have two arms extending from shoulder
joints at the bottom of their necks.  The slender arms are Y-shaped
with two forearms extending from each elbow.  These arms end in hands
with two opposable fingers.

Ursic society is matriarchal.  The full-sized members of the race
are female.  Each female has a pouch on the front part of the body.
While this pouch is used to nurse new-born,  it is also used to house
the Urs' mate, a tiny sized male member of the race.  The males are
fully intelligent and communicative, but tiny and much less physically
capable than the females.

The Traeki
~~~~~~~~~~

The Traeki are genderless creatures composed of stacks or squishy,
fleshy rings arranged into a conical shape anywhere from 2 to 12 feet
tall, depending on how many rings are in the stack.  An individual
ring is not an intelligent, independent creature.  Only when a stack
is large enough and composed of certain combinations of ring types is
the stack considered a Traeki.  The bare minimum for a stack to be
considered a Traeki includes at least one sensory ring, a cognition
ring, and a control ring capable of coordinating the activities of the
other rings.  To be a fully functional member of Jarn society, a
Traeki would also require an ambulatory or swimming ring, one or more
manipulation rings, and a vocalization ring.  Additional rings can be
added to enhance the abilities of an individual Traeki, however there
is a limit to how tall a Traeki can be with a single control ring.  It
is rare to find a well-functioning Traeki with multiple control rings,
although such individuals might come together for short periods and
specific purposes.

Traeki live in humid, marshy locations which are well suited to
nurturing their "young", which are new ring segments sprouted off of
reproductive rings using genetic material collected from existing
rings (either in an individual stack or from a creche).  These sprouts
are grown in creches attended by Traeki with empathy rings specialized
for this purpose.

The physical variability of Traeki is enormous, with very few having
the same configuration of rings.  Their specialization for different
roles in Traeki and broader society is similarly enormous.  For
example, manipulation rings can be grown with a wide variety of "arm"
types.  The "arms" sprouting form the manipulation rings can range
from 2 or 8 (or higher) in number.  They can be short and stout, long
and willowy, rigid or floppy, and end in "hands" of astounding
variety.

Communication among rings in an individual Traeki and among different
Traeki stack is by exchange of chemicals emitted the rings.  This
allows for very rapid and sophisticated short-range communication and
for the possibility of extremely long-range communication.  It also
makes Traeki somewhat difficult to encounter for the first time.
Their scent can be very off-putting for other creatures, even
triggering allergic reactions for some.  However, this same ability
makes them extraordinary at certain professions.  For example, most
healers on Jarn are Traeki.  A Traeki stack with a appropriate sensory
and chemistry stacks can simply detect ailments in other creatures and
generate potions tailored to the specific problem.  Traeki with rings
capable to manipulating magic are accomplished mages and alchemists.

:Armor class:   8 or higher

 **STR**    **DEX**    **CON**    **INT**    **WIS**    **CHA**

Any of these skills can naturally be as low as 3 or as high as 15 in a
commoner depending on its arrangement of rings.
